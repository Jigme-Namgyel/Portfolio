        <h1>Shoe Shop</h1>

        <div class="section-title">The Product</div>
        <p>
          Shoe shop sells shoes under two primary categories (e.g., Casual and
          Formal footwear). The website allows users to browse these categories,
          add shoes to their cart, and make purchases directly through the
          platform.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">The Problem</div>
        <p>
          There is currently no dedicated online platform for buying footwear,
          making it difficult for customers to find and compare shoe
          options—especially for casual and formal shoes. Shoppers often rely on
          scattered social media posts or visit physical stores, which lack
          transparency in pricing and limited variety. This creates a
          frustrating experience for users who want convenience, clear
          information, and options tailored to their needs.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">The Goal</div>
        <p>
          Develop a more intuitive and engaging shoe shopping web application
          that allows users to browse by category, confidently choose the right
          shoe (size, color), and complete purchases with ease. The platform
          should aim to reduce cart abandonment and improve user satisfaction
          through a seamless shopping journey.

          <span>What was learned:</span> Throughout the design process, several
          important insights were uncovered. User research and usability testing
          emphasized the need for intuitive navigation and a visually engaging
          layout tailored for a Shoe Shop web application. Iterative testing and
          feedback helped refine core features to meet user expectations—such as
          browsing footwear by type, viewing detailed product descriptions, and
          completing secure checkouts. Additionally, accessibility and
          customization options like filtering by size, color, and purpose
          (e.g., casual or sports) proved crucial in enhancing the overall
          shopping experience.
        </p>
        <p class="speech-bubble right">
          <span>Next steps:</span> Moving forward, the focus will be on
          developing the high-fidelity prototype into a fully functional Shoe
          Shop web application. Collaboration with developers will be key to
          ensuring the design is accurately implemented for real-world use.
          Continued user testing will guide future iterations and improvements.
          Potential upcoming features include loyalty rewards, size-fit guides,
          real-time order tracking, and user account personalization to increase
          user engagement and satisfaction.
