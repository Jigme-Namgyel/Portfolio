        <h1>GameHive</h1>

        <div class="section-title">The Product</div>
        <p>
          GameHive is an e-commerce platform built for gamers to buy a wide
          range of gaming products, including accessories, hardware,
          merchandise, and collectibles. The platform aims to be a one-stop shop
          for gaming needs across different devices (PC, console, mobile). Users
          can explore, purchase, and receive their products with ease through a
          smooth online experience.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">The Problem</div>
        <p>
          There is currently no dedicated online platform for buying gaming
          equipment in Bhutan and nearby regions. Gamers often rely on generic
          e-commerce sites or scattered social media posts to find gaming
          products, which makes it hard to verify authenticity, compatibility,
          or availability. This fragmented experience results in difficulty
          finding suitable gear, a lack of trust in quality, and frustration
          over unclear pricing, delivery options, and support. Without a
          specialized platform, gamers lack a convenient and reliable way to
          purchase gaming accessories, hardware, and merchandise tailored to
          their needs.
        </p>

        <div class="section-title">The Goal</div>
        <p>
          To improve user satisfaction and conversions, GameHive aims to
          introduce a structured and user-friendly categorization system that
          helps users quickly find what they’re looking for. This includes
          adding filters (e.g., platform, type, price), enhancing product detail
          pages, and simplifying the checkout process. The ultimate goal is to
          reduce drop-offs, increase user trust, and provide a frictionless
          shopping experience.

          <span>What was learned:</span> Throughout the design and research
          process of the GameHive web application, valuable insights emerged
          about gamer behaviors and preferences. Usability studies and
          participant feedback emphasized the importance of clear platform-based
          filters (PC, PS5, Xbox), intuitive navigation, and compatibility
          guidance. Users appreciated the sleek interface and customization
          features but also highlighted areas for improvement, such as better
          visibility for product filters and enhanced order tracking. Staff
          insights further reinforced the need for streamlined backend tools to
          manage orders and prioritize deliveries, especially during peak hours.
          These findings helped refine the user experience for both shoppers and
          store administrators.
        </p>
        <p class="speech-bubble right">
          <span>Next steps:</span> Moving forward, the focus will shift to
          transforming the high-fidelity prototype into a fully functional,
          responsive web platform. This phase will involve collaboration with
          developers to implement all design features, ensure mobile and desktop
          optimization, and integrate backend order management tools. Continuous
          user testing will guide feature enhancements, including compatibility
          guides, loyalty programs, delivery scheduling tools, and real-time
          notifications. The goal is to deliver a seamless shopping experience
          that caters to all types of gamers while supporting staff with
          efficient management tools.
